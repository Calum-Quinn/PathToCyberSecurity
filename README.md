# Path to Cyber Security

The aim of this repository is to centralise and document my learning process.

As the title suggests I want to learn all about cyber security.

At the moment (06.03.2024) I'm having a hard time finding how to start this journey. 
It feels like there are enormous amounts of material for learning other computer science related topics. 
When it comes to security though I have found either too basic courses which simply cover the terms and basic ideas or courses / challenges which are far beyond my reach with the very limited knowledge I posess on the subject at the moment.

A website which has been very highly recommended to me is [Root-Me](https://www.root-me.org/?lang=en) which focuses on learning security concepts by applying them in small ethical hacking challenges.
For the time being I attempted two of them and had a hard time getting anywhere even though the difficulty rating was very low.
This has encouraged me even more to try and find a proper beginner's guide / course.

This repository should be split into various sections for each of my attempts at finding the right material.
