# SpringBoard Course

This section will be dedicated to documenting my progress for [this course](https://www.springboard.com/learning-paths/cybersecurity-foundations/learn/) from `springboard.com`.

## Jobs
From the start, the course keeps recommending we compare different cyber security jobs and choose the ones that appeal the most.
This is so that we know what to look for when getting a job but also what material to study as there is a large range of different subjects.

The ones that stand out to me are:
- **Malware Analyst**: Analysing malicious software to understand the threat, the entrypoint, exploits and the nature of it.
- **Chief Information Security Officer**: Leading staff in identifying, developing, implementing and maintaining processes accross an organization. Responsible for information-related compliance.
- **Cyber Defense Analyst**: Primary security contact (mostly for small to mid size organizations), must deal with engineering and architecture, incident triage and response, security toll administration and more.
- **Security Engineer**: Designing, implementing and tuning an effective combination of network-centric and data-centric controls to balance prevention, detection and response.
- **Pen Tester**: Penetration testing to probe the security integrity of a company's defenses by evaluating the attack surface of all in-scope vulnerable web-based services, client-side applications, server-side processes and more.
